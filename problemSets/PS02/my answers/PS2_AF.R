# Summary of the model
summary(model_interaction)

#The main effects of countries and sanctions are significant (p < 0.001),
#indicating that both variables have a significant effect on the likelihood
#of supporting the policy.

# Global null hypothesis and p-value
null_hypothesis <- "There is no relationship between the predictors and the likelihood of an individual supporting the policy."
p_value <- summary(model_interaction)$coefficients[1, "Pr(>|z|)"]

# Print the global null hypothesis and p-value

#Question 2
# Extract coefficient for the interaction term between countries and sanctions
interaction_coef <- coef(model_interaction)["countries.L:sanctions.L"]

# Interpretation of the coefficient
cat("The coefficient for the interaction term between countries and sanctions is:", interaction_coef, "\n\n")

cat("For each one-unit increase in sanctions (from 5% to 15%), the odds of supporting the policy\n")
cat("are multiplied by exp(", interaction_coef, ") = ", exp(interaction_coef), "\n\n")

#For each one-unit increase in sanctions (from 5% to 15%), 
#the odds of supporting the policy are multiplied by
#exp(-0.001754016) â‰ˆ 0.9982475.

#This implies that increasing sanctions from 5% to 15% is associated
#with a slight decrease in the odds of supporting the policy. 
#However, the effect is minimal, indicating that the change in odds
#is not substantial.

#2B
# Define the values of countries and sanctions
countries_value <- "80 of 192"
sanctions_value <- "None"

# Predict the probability using the logistic regression model
predicted_probability <- predict(model_interaction,

# Print the estimated probability

#The estimated probability that an individual will support the policy
#if there are 80 of 192 countries participating with 
#no sanctions is: 0.5252101 

#2C
# Fit logistic regression model without the interaction term
model_no_interaction <- glm(choice ~ countries + sanctions, data = climateSupport, family = binomial)

# Perform likelihood ratio test
lrt <- anova(model_no_interaction, model_interaction, test = "Chisq")

# Print the results
print(lrt)

#In this case, the p-value (Pr(>Chi)) is 0.3912, 
#which is greater than the significance level of 0.05. 
#Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the model 
#without the interaction term is sufficient. 
#This suggests that including the interaction term does not 
#significantly improve the model's fit.
